# Solidity Learning  

## What is Solidity?

Solidity is an object-oriented programming language created by the Ethereum Network team for designing and developing Smart Contracts in the Blockchain world. You can automate transactions and perform various other tasks through this programming language.  
If you get towards the core of Solidity, you will find it pretty similar to JavaScript. So, if you are good with JavaScript, you can get easily acquainted with Solidity. On top of that, you will also find Solidity to be a bit similar to C++ and Python.  
As Solidity is a high-level language, you will have to function with letters and numbers. So, it becomes pretty easy to understand. Just like Python, you will have to use the concept of inheritance and include various libraries for programming in Solidity.
